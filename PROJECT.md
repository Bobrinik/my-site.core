## [Project](https://github.com/Bobrinik/my-site.core)

- It's not fun updating GitHub portfolio website manually. Also, it's not fun figuring out how it can be done with `Jekyll`. However, it's fun learning how to do it in ClojureScript and make it as effortless as possible.

## Project Difficulties

- There are not many  tutorials around the net about ClojureScript compared to JS frameworks. Also, tutorial that are out might not be up to date.

## Solution

- I looked for books since books contain fundamental information about functioning of ClojureScript that other resources might not cover in depth. I found that `Learning ClojureScript by W. David Jarvis, Rafik Naccache and Allen Rohner ` is a good resource with lots of examples. Some of their examples are using frameworks. I double checked frameworks to make sure that they are still relevant. For those that are not I researched Stack Overflow and Clojure website. 

## Technology used

- ClojureScript
- figwheel-main, ajax, markdown to hiccup, sablono templating library and om.
